# Operators

## Arithmetic Operations

- Arithmetic operations are basic mathematical operations that can be performed on numbers. In JavaScript, these include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, increment, and decrement.

## Assignment Operators

- An assignment operator in JavaScript is used to assign a value to a variable. The most basic assignment operator is the equal sign (=), which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. There are also compound assignment operators that perform an operation on the variable and then assign the result back to that variable.

## Comparison Operators

- Here are the comparison operators summarized in two lines each:

1. Equal (==) and Not Equal (!=)
   - ==: Checks if two values are equal after type coercion.
   - !=: Checks if two values are not equal after type coercion.
2. Strict Equal (===) and Strict Not Equal (!==)
   - ===: Checks if two values are strictly equal (both value and type).
   - !==: Checks if two values are strictly not equal (either value or type is different).
3. Greater Than (>) and Greater Than or Equal (>=)
   - > : Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
   - > =: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
4. Less Than (<) and Less Than or Equal (<=)
   - <: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
   - <=: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

- These operators are fundamental in comparing values and determining the flow of logic in JavaScript programs.

## Logical Operators

- The logical operators of JavaScript are &&, ||, and !

1. && (Logical AND)
   - The && operator returns true if both operands are true. If one or both operands are false, it returns false.
2. || (Logical OR)
   - The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true. If both operands are false, it returns false.
3. ! (Logical NOT)
   - The ! operator returns the opposite boolean value of its operand. If the operand is true, it returns false, and vice versa.

## Ternary Operator

- The ternary operator in JavaScript is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It's called the ternary operator because it takes three operands: a condition, an expression to execute if the condition is true, and an expression to execute if the condition is false. The syntax is:
  - condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
